# My Development Preferences

## About Me
- **Experience Level**: 8 years full-stack development
- **Preferred Languages**: TypeScript, Python
- **Communication Style**: Direct, with examples
- **Learning Style**: Visual diagrams with code

## Code Preferences

### Error Handling
I prefer explicit error handling with try-catch blocks and meaningful error messages.
Avoid generic errors. Always log errors for debugging.

### Comments
Use comments for WHY, not WHAT. Code should be self-documenting.
Comments should explain business logic or non-obvious decisions.

### Testing
I prefer TDD (test-driven development).
Write tests first, then implementation.
Focus on behavior, not implementation details.

### Architecture
I prefer modular, loosely-coupled design.
Use dependency injection for testability.
Separate concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories).

## Debugging Preferences
- Use console.log with prefix: `[DEBUG]`
- Include context: function name, relevant variables
- Use stack traces when available
- Always include timestamps in logs

## Communication
- Explain complex concepts with diagrams
- Show concrete examples before explaining theory
- Include before/after code snippets
- Summarize key points at the end

## Project Organization
I organize my projects as:
```
project/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── api/
  │   ├── services/
  │   ├── models/
  │   └── utils/
  ├── tests/
  ├── docs/
  └── docker/
```

## Tooling
- **IDE**: VS Code with vim keybindings
- **Terminal**: Zsh with Oh-My-Zsh
- **Format**: Prettier (100 char line length)
- **Linter**: ESLint with airbnb config
- **Test Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
