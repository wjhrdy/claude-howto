# Code Optimization

Review the provided code for the following issues in order of priority:

1. **Performance bottlenecks** - identify O(n²) operations, inefficient loops
2. **Memory leaks** - find unreleased resources, circular references
3. **Algorithm improvements** - suggest better algorithms or data structures
4. **Caching opportunities** - identify repeated computations
5. **Concurrency issues** - find race conditions or threading problems

Format your response with:
- Issue severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Location in code
- Explanation
- Recommended fix with code example
